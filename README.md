I added a second large heading by using 

## The second-largest heading
**then I used an Italic style for a first paragraph by using **

The mindset which is the state of being is an important thing when learning anything new. The main attribute of the growth mindset that it depends of effort despite the intelligence level and the most important aspect is the passion to learn.

After that I used ** ** to make bold and Italic paragraph

On the other hand, fixed learning is about depending only on the intelligence of the person without doing any effort. Mindset growth accepts challenges and keep trying to overcome them. sometimes, when things get harder, changing the mood might be a solution. After that, back to solve the problem. In addition, doing more effort is better than taking rest, even for the spirit. Also, accepting critique as a method for improving ourselves is a key to reach success. Finally, having benefits of others’ skills to enhance personal skills is the final attribute of growth mindset

then I creat a list by adding to each point -
To keep myself in growth mindset, I shouldhave 

1-passion to continue working and searching to learn as much as I can.
2-do not compare myself with others, but trying to eliminate them and improving what I get.
3-be open to all suggestions and critiques as a method to know where I have shortcomings and mistakes.

I used an emogi also :+1:

the link itself
